# JIRA plugin for Visual Studio #

### Developments since Atlassian dropped it ###

This plugin no longer has any of the Bamboo features or other Atlassian services it is purely a JIRA plugin now.
The mods are too many to go through, see commit logs for a list but it is now a visx extension and works on Visual Studio 2013 and 2015. 
I have dropped some of the more glossy features like trying to pull down peoples images etc so what we have now is a simple JIRA manager.
